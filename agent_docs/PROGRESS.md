# Progress

**Current session:** 0.3 (complete)

## Done
- 0.0: Project rules (`CLAUDE.md`), progress tracking (`agent_docs/PROGRESS.md`,
  `agent_docs/ROADMAP.md`), permission allowlist (`.claude/settings.json`),
  `agent_runs/` gitignored. Working on branch `agent` (tracks `origin/agent` on the
  acceleroto fork).
- 0.0 follow-up: full plan copied into `agent_docs/ROADMAP.md`; CLAUDE.md gained the
  `--target`/absolute-path/steam_appid rules from the plan.

- 0.1 (user, 2026-10-05): manual export WORKS. Release binary,
  `--export-material --target "Unity/URP"` on `examples/bricks.ptex`. Output folder had
  `bricks.mat` + `bricks_albedo`, `bricks_height`, `bricks_metal_smoothness`,
  `bricks_normal`, `bricks_occlusion` PNGs. Copied to `MM-Agent-Test/Assets/out/`; material
  on a sphere renders bricks correctly with a URP shader (Unity 6.5, 6000.5.5f1, Metal).
  No magenta, no steam_appid workaround reported.
- 0.2 (agent, 2026-10-05): edited release `bricks.ptex` (parameters only: mortar colour via
  `colorize_0` gradient → blue, `graph/Bricks.mortar` 0.05→0.15), exported Unity/URP to
  `agent_runs/0.2/out/` (~5.2 s/export); both changes visible in albedo + normal.
  Findings in `agent_docs/phase0_notes.md`: exports hang if launched from the Bash tool
  (use the Terminal panel); `Bricks.repeat/rows/columns` edits had NO effect on output
  (unexplained); exporter won't create nested out dirs and doesn't quit on that error.
  CLAUDE.md updated with the export workaround.
- 0.3 (agent, 2026-10-05): 5-iteration loop on "weathered red roof tiles, slightly mossy,
  stylized", starting from release `examples/improved_brick.ptex` (no roof example exists).
  `agent_runs/0.3/iter_1..5/` each have build.py, roof.ptex, out/ (Unity/URP), sheet.png,
  critique.md. Converged roughly: iter 5 is a plausible stylized mossy red roof. Biggest blockers:
  graph/port semantics (lost iter 2 to a blend-port mistake), then judging from flat maps
  (wrote a Lambert-lit preview sheet). Findings + tool wishlist appended to phase0_notes.md.
  Prototype helpers (export.sh with DONE marker, g.py edit API, sheet.py) in
  `agent_tools/proto_0.3/`.

## In progress
- None.

## Blockers
- None hard. Open question: why `Bricks.repeat`/`rows`/`columns` edits are ignored on export
  (check in GUI when convenient). Exports must run via `run_in_terminal`.

## Next step
- 0.4 — **human decision** (see ROADMAP.md "### 0.4"): the user opens `agent_runs/0.3/`
  (look at `iter_*/sheet.png` + `critique.md`), reads the 0.3 section of
  `agent_docs/phase0_notes.md`, and chooses: Phase 1 (normal path), Phase 1 then prioritise
  Phase 4 (previews), or troubleshoot export. Agent's recommendation: Phase 1, then prioritise
  Phase 4: flat maps were the second-biggest blocker. No agent work until the user decides.
